                <h3 class="text-deep-blue">3. How We Use Information</h3>
                <p>Abstract Machines acts as the Data Controller for the processing of personal data as described in
                    this Policy. We do not use automated decision-making or profiling for marketing purposes without
                    explicit consent. Where data is used for research, it is aggregated and anonymized to prevent
                    identification of individuals or organizations.</p>

                <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To deliver and operate our services and features;</li>
                    <li>To maintain account security and authenticate users;</li>
                    <li>To respond to inquiries and provide customer support;</li>
                    <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce terms of service;</li>
                    <li>To monitor service performance and enhance platform reliability;</li>
                    <li>To analyze usage for product improvement and R&D;</li>
                    <li>To send operational or service-related notifications (not marketing emails unless consent is
                        given).</li>

                <h3 class="text-deep-blue">4. Sharing of Information</h3>
                <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with third parties in the
                    following situations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With service providers</strong> who process data on our behalf under strict
                        confidentiality and security agreements;</li>
                    <li><strong>In compliance with legal obligations</strong>, such as responding to court orders or
                        regulatory inquiries;</li>
                    <li><strong>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale</strong>, where your data may be
                        transferred under similar terms of protection;</li>
                    <li><strong>With explicit user consent</strong>, when such sharing is necessary to integrate with a
                        third-party service you’ve authorized.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Where third parties act as data processors (subcontractors), we ensure adequate data processing
                    agreements (DPAs) are in place. Data may be shared across Abstract Machines’ affiliated entities to
                    fulfill service obligations. We retain audit rights over any vendor processing personal data on our
                    behalf to ensure compliance with applicable privacy standards.</p>

                <h3 class="text-deep-blue">5. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy,
                    including legal, security, and business continuity requirements. Device telemetry and platform
                    metadata may be retained longer in anonymized or aggregated form for research and operational
                    analytics.</p>
                <p>Retention periods vary depending on the nature of the data and legal requirements. For example,
                    billing-related data may be retained for up to 10 years under financial regulations, while
                    support-related logs may be retained for 12 months. Where contractual retention or deletion terms
                    exist, we honor them accordingly.</p>

                <p>We also conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-deep-blue">12. Cookie Policy</h3>
                <p>We use "cookies" and similar technologies on our websites and web applications to enhance
                    functionality, improve performance, and better understand how users interact with our services. A
                    cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser and stored on your device when you visit a
                    website or use an application. These files allow us to recognize your device during subsequent
                    visits—even if we do not know your identity.</p>

                <p>We may use the following types of cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Temporary cookies that are deleted once you close your
                        browser. These help enable essential website features during your visit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Cookies stored on your device for a longer period (e.g., up
                        to 2 years) to retain preferences such as language, login state, or interface configuration.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Cookies used to collect anonymized information on how users
                        interact with our services so we can continuously improve them.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you may modify your settings to block
                    or delete cookies at any time. Please note that disabling cookies may affect your experience and
                    limit access to certain features (e.g., login sessions, form persistence, etc.).</p>

                <p>By continuing to use our websites and applications, or by subscribing to our communications (such as
                    newsletters), you consent to the use of cookies and related tracking technologies. If you do not
                    wish to accept cookies, you are responsible for configuring your browser accordingly.</p>

                <h5 class="text-deep-blue mt-4">Google Analytics</h5>
                <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (U.S.), to analyze usage
                    trends and improve our services. Google Analytics sets cookies to collect anonymized information
                    such as pages visited, browser type, time spent on pages, and referring domains. We do not transmit
                    personally identifiable information to Google.</p>

                <p>Google may process this data on servers outside your jurisdiction and may associate it with activity
                    on other websites. For more details, please refer to Google’s own <a
                        href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.
                    You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the <a
                        href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics
                        Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

                <h5 class="text-deep-blue mt-4">Third-Party Services</h5>
                <p>Aside from Google Analytics, Abstract Machines does not currently use behavioral tracking or
                    recording services like Hotjar or FullStory. If we integrate additional analytics or third-party
                    tools in the future, this Policy will be updated accordingly with full transparency.</p>

                <h5 class="text-deep-blue mt-4">Managing Cookies</h5>
                <p>You can manage, block, or delete cookies at any time via your browser settings. Refer to your
